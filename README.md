Wikicours is an online repository of school lessons that anyone can improve through a wiki ✏️📚

You can see it as a “Wikipedia of school lessons”, all the content is under free license 🆓🎓

For now at least, it is only in French and built for the French school programs, but you contribute to the project even if you don't speak French! 🇫🇷🌍

The topics targeted are those covered by the official school curriculum, for all classes in middle school and school (French collège and lycée). 🏫

> To know more, you can read the article explaining the goals of the project and the idea behind it: 👀 http://medium.com/@thomaskuntz/wikifying-educational-resources-84a6daf9d234

The name could translate to Wikicourse in English.

## Mozilla Global Sprint

This project is participating in the [Mozilla Global Sprint](https://mzl.la/global-sprint)! 🎉🎉🎉

Mozilla Global Sprint is a global online hackathon dedicated to building projects for a healthy Internet. ✨💻🌐🌍

Anyone is welcome to contribute, regardless of your experience or skillset! If are new to the Global Sprint or to Open Source in general, check out [this sort guide](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues/299). 😉

## Contributing 👋🤝

⚠️ As of now, we mainly need help in three areas:

* 📚 __Lessons to publish__: We're actively looking for people willing to contribute learning material to the project. We need: courses, exercises and test subjects with worked-out answers, methodology sheets, revision sheets, or really _anything that can be useful for French students at the collège (middle school) and lycée (high school) level_. (see [how to upload your material](https://github.com/thomaskuntzz/wikicours/issues/8))
* 🎨 __Design__: The design we have right now is extremely bare-bones and not really attractive. We would love to see suggestions for a new design or for improving what we have now. We have also no branding for the project yet, so we would love to see suggestions too! (se [the issue about this](https://github.com/thomaskuntzz/wikicours/issues/7))
* 💻 __Website development__: The website is only at the prototype stage. Any help for implementing a better design, adding some features or sections, improving the content (e.g the homepage), making some tweaks or anything else is very welcome! (see [related issue](https://github.com/thomaskuntzz/wikicours/issues/3))

We'll welcome any help with this or if you have any other idea or suggestion ! 💡 Just reach out on the [Gitter commnity chat](https://gitter.im/Wikicours/General)! 🗣💬

Oh, and a note about the name: I'm note a huge fan of the name “Wikicours”, but that's the best one I could come up with. If you have *any idea for another name* I'd love to hear about it! 🏷 (see [the issue](https://github.com/thomaskuntzz/wikicours/issues/6))

> Be sure to check out our small [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info!
