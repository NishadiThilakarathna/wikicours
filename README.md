Wikicours is an online repository of school lessons that anyone can improve through a wiki ✏️📚
<br />
You can see it as a “Wikipedia of school lessons”, all the content is under free license 🆓🎓

For now at least, it is only in French and built for the French school programs, but you contribute to the project even if you don't speak French! 🇫🇷🌍

The topics targeted are those covered by the official school curriculum, for all classes in middle school and school (French collège and lycée). 🏫

> To know more, you can read the article explaining the goals of the project and the idea behind it: 👀 http://medium.com/@thomaskuntz/wikifying-educational-resources-84a6daf9d234

The name could translate to Wikicourse in English.
